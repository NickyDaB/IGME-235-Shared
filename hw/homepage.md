# Homework: Create a 235 home page

## I. Overview
For this assignment you will create a personal 235 "home page" where you will be able to post links to the projects you will complete for this course.

## II. Requirements
* The page will be named index.html
* The page will be located at `http://people.rit.edu/yourid/235/`
  - This is critical. Please get the location correct. The directory name should just be the three digits, no "igme" with it.  We will make links to everyone's Home Page and they must follow this pattern.

Your page's design is up to you, but it needs to contain the following elements:
* A level-1 heading that reads "YOUR NAME's 235 Page" (replacing "YOUR NAME" with your own name, obviously)
* A **recognizable** photo of yourself (not the back of your head, not a drawing, not you wearing a mask) -- funny we wrote that long before COVID, but we'd still like to see the real "maskless" you.
* A brief bio about yourself (a paragraph will do), telling us about your interests and your goals; what do you hope to get out of the class, your major, your time at RIT, and where do you want to be when you graduate?
* Placeholder links to each of the 3 class projects.
  - You do not need to create links to your past homework exercises, but you are welcome to do so if you wish.
* A link to your GitHub repo for this class
* A pleasing (or at least tolerable) color scheme and layout.
  - Try to consider at least some of the principles described in this chapter of a book about presentation design: [The Big Four: Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity](http://www.presentationzen.com/chapter6_spread.pdf).  We will revisit these concepts & other design principles in a week or so.
  - We expect you to use the CSS Box Model and positioning to apply basic layout to your page, however, if you read ahead, you may also use Flexbox and/or CSS Grid techniques to improve your layout.
* You should use an *external CSS* file for all of your styles.
  - Your CSS should include at least 2 ID selectors and 2 class selectors
* You must also change all the anchors (links) on your page to match your color scheme (changing all five states)
* Your page needs to pass validation on [Validator.nu](https://html5.validator.nu/) and the W3C [CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
